                    give you insight into who I am and what I am like.

            <h2>Today</h2>
            <h3>A mother's birthday</h3>

            <p>
                Today was my mom's birthday! I woke up late but still got to wish her. We decided we would go out for dinner
                later that day to celebrate. I took some time by myself to remember how grateful I was that she was in my
                life and how much she has taught me and given me all these years. I still understood the need to be independent,
                but that need was not mutually exclusive from storge (familial love). I hope I can maximize the time I spend with her 
                before I must leave back to UCSD. 
            </p>
            <p>I realized that I needed to finish some work and errands, so I was still busy for the afternoon. I finished:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>My MATH 183 Online Homework</li>
                <li>Reading (for myself) <u>Database Internals</u></li>
                <li>My CSE 110 Reading Quiz</li>
                <li>Planning for the Week</li>
                <li>Watering the Plants</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I still made it for dinner, and had a blast! It was an Indian vegetarian restaurant, and I got my 
                fill of dosa and sambar. Hanging out with my brothers and parents outside was a nice break from 
                being at home just playing games or doing work. It was acctually relaxing.
            </p>
            <p>
                In any case, I need to go to sleep now, so here's to hoping I grow some more this week!

            <h2>Yesterday</h2>
            <h3>Let me go in the wind already</h3>

            <p>
                Wow I'm tired. I was just hanging out with my friends at the park today, and we had some boba.
                I had some black tea with aloe jelly, which was tasty enough. We also ended up walking around the park
                and playing some frisbee and Monkey in the Middle. It was relaxing yet challenging. My muscles might sore
                tomorrow haha. I got to see some dogs in the park too and man were they so gentle and loving. I just have
                so much agape for them (unconditional love). So even though I'm tired right now, I'm good tired. I'm tired
                in the sense that I feel content with what I did today.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I'm doing a little bit of homework and catching up on some lectures and reading for one of my classes.
                What I'm planning to finish today, in no particular order:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>CSE 140 Lectures</li>
                <li>CSE 140L Lectures</li>
                <li>CSE 140 Reading</li>
                <li>CSE 140 Homework</li>
                <li>Meditation (though it's not a task but a habit)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Sometimes even though I'm just sitting doing work in an adequately heated room, I just want to 
                be in front of the natural breeze I felt today in the park. It feels like it's whisking you 
                away, at least for a bit.

            <a id="two-days-ago"></a>
            <h2>2 Days Ago</h2>
            <h3>I feel reborn from the dreariness</h3>

            <p>
                I usually don't get much work done, because I tend to be mildly lazy if I don't have a steadfast
                goal that I actually want to strive towards. But today, just magically, I ended up doing a lot of work!
                I think meditation in the morning definitely helped, but it was more than that. It felt like a switch
                flipped and I just... could do the work again. Weird, but definitely something to keep watching. It helps
                me anyway right now because I have long hated my lazy lifestyle. Why it changed now, of all days, is a wonder.
            </p>

            <p>
                One videogame I do want to play again soon on my older brother's PS5 is Dragon Age:Inquisition. I can't play it once
                I go back to campus, so I need to make sure I can play it at least once next week for cherishing. It's a damn
                fun game. You should try it. One scene that really meant a lot to me was:
            </p>

            <details>
                <summary>Dragon Age:Inquisition, "The Dawn Will Come"</summary>
                <audio controls src="dai.mp3"></audio>
            </details>

            <p>
                Also, I tried out the deep fake AI simulator which makes it so that the picture of a person becomes
                a video of them singing a song. But one time I did it for my plush toy puppy, and this is the result
                haha:
